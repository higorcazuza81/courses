# Your First Application - Sabor Express Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Sabor Express** repository, a practical project from the course **"Python: Create Your First Application"**. In this module, we developed a back-end application to manage the registration of restaurants in a food delivery application. The goal is to explore the fundamental concepts of Python programming, applying best coding practices such as data manipulation, function structure, the use of conditionals and loops, as well as exception handling.

This project focuses on building a simple yet functional application using lists, dictionaries, and object-oriented programming (OOP).

## Project Objectives

The project had the following main objectives:

- Create a basic back-end application using Python.
- Apply the concepts of **object-oriented programming (OOP)**, such as **classes**, **functions**, and data manipulation.
- Implement functionality to **register restaurants** and their **categories**.
- Organize restaurant data using **lists** and **dictionaries**.
- Develop an **interactive application**, allowing the user to interact via menus and options.
- Use execution control blocks `try-except` to **handle exceptions** and ensure the program runs robustly.

## Key Learnings

Throughout the course, the following concepts and techniques were covered:

### String Manipulation
- How to use **strings** to display messages and interact with the user through menus in the terminal.

### Modules and Functions
- How to structure the code using **functions** for better organization and code reuse.

### Lists, Loops, and Exceptions
- How to use **lists** to store restaurants and apply **loops** (`for`, `while`) to navigate through interactive options.
- Implementation of **exceptions** with `try-except` to ensure the code is safer and doesn't break with unexpected inputs.

### Dictionaries
- How to use **dictionaries** to store detailed restaurant information, such as **name**, **category**, and **address**, simulating a simple database.

### Knowledge Consolidation
- Practical application of all the learned concepts by building an interactive application that allows registering and managing restaurants in a functional way.

## Implementation

In this project, an interactive restaurant registration system was created, where the user can:

- **Register restaurants** with basic information such as name, category, and address.
- **View the list of registered restaurants**.
- **Update the information** of an existing restaurant.
- **Delete restaurants** from the list.

The interaction occurs through a menu displayed in the terminal, where the user selects the desired options. The code is modular, utilizing functions for different functionalities, and input/output operations are handled with exceptions to prevent failures.

## Technologies Used

This project uses the following technologies:

- **Programming Language**: [Python](https://www.python.org/) - The language used to develop the application.
- **Development Tool**: [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Used to edit the code and run the project.
- **Programming Paradigm**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - The code was structured using classes and objects for better organization and reuse.
- **Environment Manager**: [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) - Used to manage project dependencies and create isolated virtual environments.

## How to Run the Project

### Setting up the Environment

1. **Install Miniconda**:
   If you don't have Miniconda installed, download the latest version [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   After installing Miniconda, create a new virtual environment with Python 3.x (replace `myenv` with a name of your choice):

   ```bash
   conda create --name myenv python=3.x
