# Python Courses

This repository is dedicated to documenting and versioning my progress through Python courses. These courses are part of a structured learning path aimed at building strong back-end development skills with Python, leveraging frameworks such as Django and Flask, and exploring advanced topics like AI-powered tools and APIs.

## Objective
The goal of this repository is to organize and track my journey through Python development, starting from foundational programming concepts to building robust web applications and working with Artificial Intelligence tools. It serves as a reference and showcases my progress and projects developed throughout the learning path.

## Course Structure
The courses are organized into the following modules:

1. **Object-Oriented Programming with Python**
   - Core principles of OOP.
   - Implementation of OOP concepts in Python.

2. **Django REST APIs: Building REST Applications**
   - REST API design and development.
   - Practical projects with Django REST framework.

3. **Building Applications with Django**
   - End-to-end web application development.
   - Database integration and deployment.

4. **Getting Started with Flask**
   - Introduction to Flask for lightweight web apps.
   - Working with routes, templates, and extensions.

5. **OpenAI and Python**
   - Creating tools and chatbots with OpenAI APIs.
