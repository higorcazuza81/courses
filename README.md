# Courses Repository

Welcome to the Courses repository! This central repository is designed to organize and showcase all the courses I have completed or am currently pursuing. Here, you will find projects, materials, and practical exercises related to various key areas of learning essential for my journey as a Quantitative Analyst and Data Scientist.

## Overview

This repository serves as a structured and organized collection of my studies, reflecting the evolution of my technical skills across different domains. Each course emphasizes the exploration of concepts, problem-solving approaches, and the practical application of knowledge. This setup facilitates both content review and future project expansion.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured to ensure intuitive navigation and easy access to content. Each learning area has its own directory, subdivided into specific courses:
```
/courses
  └── /sql_courses
      └── alura_sql_basics
          ├── 01_sql_instructions
          ├── 02_sql_queries
          └── 03_sql_joins_views_transactions
```

Each course directory contains its own relevant materials and exercises. For example, the `sql_courses` directory contains all my SQL-related coursework, and the `python_courses` directory includes Python projects and exercises.

## Highlights

- **Structured Organization**: Courses are divided by learning areas for clarity and ease of navigation.
